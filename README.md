# 🖼️ COCO Classification with BEiT Model

## 📝 Project Overview
This project implements image classification on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset using the BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers) model from Hugging Face. The implementation leverages state-of-the-art transformer architecture for accurate object classification.

## 🚀 Features
- Implementation of BEiT model for image classification
- Integration with Hugging Face Transformers library
- Processing and classification of COCO dataset images
- Modern transformer-based architecture for improved accuracy

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- BEiT Model
- COCO Dataset

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
